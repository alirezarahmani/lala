Hello :)

Introduction:
-

I implement very simple(but, standard) of Domain Driven Design. 

How Works:
-

I prepare docker, just run `./start.sh` in root. After that every thing will be ready.

Notes:
-

- I implement it with main focus on maintenance. 
- Opcache is enabled.
- I use UUID instead of auto generate Id, Only to be standard in DDD, not big deal.
